            <p> I got several skills Soft Skills; <br> <span>Motivational skills:</span> I am able to listen and 
                understand people emotionally which helps me a lot when it comes to team buildings
                where people are gathered sharing their problems.I'm able to come up with a solution not a permanent one but something
                that I know will help. <br> <span>Creative skills:</span> I like figuring out how things work step by step and building things
                using the power of imagination and the fact that with coding you can make a machine do anything 
                 that is capable to do which makes it easy and fun. Besides that I also have other skills like <span> cooking,reading and time-management skills.</span></p>

    <h3> Why did I choose to pursue software Development </h3>
    <img src="images/comp.jpp" alt="">
            <p class="learn">  Well, learning to code has always been my dream career since I started thinking about career choosing back in -2019-. First, I didn't know where to start but I still believed that someday I'm gonna make ends meet and finally do that which I have always wanted to do.
                 I began searching for sites and sometimes I would be like "what has been done to this website for it to come out like this? I could ask myself" but still couldn't find that exact answer that I always wanted. I did research until I found out that programming languages are the secrets behind this beautiful and impressive sites. I went ahead and chose a language randomly because I was so curious, like I wanted to try out this programming languages and come out with a site.
            <p> I remember I chose C++ and at that time I was using my phone to code, so I wrote my first code and then clicked on the output only to find nothing, the <b><u>dissapointment!</u></b><mark> Note*</mark>  there is no progress without a sacrifice, I stayed the whole night figuring out what the problem was, only to find out a comma was missing. That is when I began coding but along the way I gave up, again went back to it ,gave up again, I mean it hasn't been easy but with the help of online experts and apps I was able to sit down and analyse myself,know what I want and start working for it.Until last year 2021 when I came across Moringa school on twitter and decided maybe I can try this.</p>
