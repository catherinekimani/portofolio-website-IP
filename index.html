            <p> I got several skills Soft Skills; <br> <span>Motivational skills:</span> I am able to listen and 
                understand people emotionally which helps me a lot when it comes to team buildings
                where people are gathered sharing their problems.I'm able to come up with a solution not a permanent one but something
                that I know will help. <br> <span>Creative skills:</span> I like figuring out how things work step by step and building things
                using the power of imagination and the fact that with coding you can make a machine do anything 
                 that is capable to do which makes it easy and fun. Besides that I also have other skills like <span> cooking,reading and time-management skills.</span></p>
